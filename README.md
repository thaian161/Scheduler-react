# Scheduler Project

Scheduler is a SPA ( single-page-application) project, where students can create, edit, and delete interview appointments in real time.

> **_React Library_** is used to build the front end, external **_API_** is used to get data, **_StoryBook_** is used to design components in isolation, **_Jet Test Framework_** is used for unit and integration testing, and **_Cypress_** is used for end-to-end testing.

This is my fifth project at LHL after [Lotide](https://github.com/thaian161/lotide), [TinyApp](https://github.com/thaian161/tinyApp), [Tweeter](https://github.com/thaian161/tweeter), and midterm project [Bake-It-Up](https://github.com/thaian161/Bake-It-Up)
